		<h1>How we make things is just as important as what we make</h1>
		<p>Bonfire Red was built around the idea that great work should be challenging, and the challenge should be fun. We strive to maintain an open culture where everyone is a contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. Itâ€™s really the people that make Bonfire Red the kind of company it is. This is one way we can highlight individual associates for adding fuel to our flame.</p>
